##### Used Google Developer tool and WebRtc to access camera of laptop and take photo and then save it in canvas
> Further you can add filters on those photos and save them in data base or local storage with HTML5 and Javascript

##### I'll advice you to go and read docs of WebRtc to understand this more.
